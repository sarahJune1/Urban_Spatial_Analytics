In collaboration with Ursula Kaczmarek

This project explores the spatial relationship between Freegan Trash Tour sites and the Manhattan neighborhoods in which they are conducted to test this assumption. It has the following aims: to determine how Trash Tour attendance figures are related based on the locations where the tours take place, and to determine whether Trash Tours are operating in places where the largest quantity of items are discarded represented as retail merchant density. By analyzing these variables, we seek to understand whether location plays any role in the attractiveness of a Trash Tour site as measured by attendance levels per site, and to find an optimized route to reap the largest potential haul for Freegans.
